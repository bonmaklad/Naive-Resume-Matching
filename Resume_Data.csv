Project Title: Celebrity Recommendation System

Client: Fankick

Nature of Employment: Full Time

Duration: Jan 2020 - Till Date

Project Details: A new matching recommendation algorithm is proposed to help an enterprise to find one or several proper celebrities as the product name Fankick , which is social engaging application. The fans group of a celebrity, his impaction value in the social network and the matching degree between the celebrity and the product are used to determine the most suitable celebrity in social network. The attribute similarities between the target customers and the fans of the celebrity are calculated via the Pearson similarity formula. Then, considering the impaction value of the celebrity and the matching degree of the celebrity and the product which can be accessed on the website or usually available from the enterprise, an evaluation index is proposed. We use some data from Fankick user interaction data show the effectiveness of our proposed matching recommendation algorithm. Moreover, the analysis shows that the products may be different which are endorsed by the same celebrity in and off the socia

 

 

Project Title: Time Series Sales Forecast

Client: zafco

Nature of Employment: Full Time

Duration: Jul 2019 - Sep 2019

Onsite / Offsite: Offsite

 

Project Details: machine-learning models for sales predictive analytics. The main goal of this project is to consider main approaches and case studies of using machine learning for sales forecasting. The effect of machine-learning generalization has been considered. This effect can be used to make sales predictions when there is a small amount of historical data for specific sales time series in the case when a new product or store is launched. A stacking approach for building regression ensemble of single models has been studied. The results show that using stacking techniques, we can improve the performance of predictive models for sales time series forecasting.

Project Details: : in the fields of biology and medicine cases have been reported in which images have been manipulated. To analyse if these manipulations can be automatically detected by software, and to find out how prevalent such manipulations are, a software system has been developed. This system focuses on copy-move manipulations on images retrieved from western blot experiments, which is a widespread technique used for analysing proteins. It contains a crawler for automatic retrieval of public- cations, an image categorization program to identify western blot images and a manipulation detector. The system has been evaluated on created sample attacks as well as on real-world data where multiple cases of image manipulation have been found
